│   things the right way otherwise you are just practicing bad habis thats no way to train yourself if you want to have real power, no more faking    │
│   stuff make sure all agents know NO SIMULATIONS, ONLY PRODUCTION PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT BASED ON THE EXISTING EDGE OPTIMIZED REST      │
│   APIS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE IN AWS, DELETE UNUSED AWS RESOURCES, NEVER DO REBUILDS OR LARGE REWRITES, ONLY PROGRESS, ONLY IMPROVE, NO BUGS,  │
│   NO SECURITY ISSUES, NO OVERLY COMPLEX OR TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS, BUILD RIGHT, CLEAN, SEAMLESS, SMOOTH, PROFESSIONAL, BEST PRACTICES ONLY. NO         │
│   EXPERIMENTING, GUESSING, OR MAKING THINGS UP, ALL AGENTS SHOULD ALREADY HAVE STRIPE API ACCESS, AWS CLI ACCESS, and GITHUB PAT TOKENS for         │
│   production pushes, all agents should treat thier project blue prints research papers and serverless.yml files as bibles and keep them clean       │
│   updated and professional for automated continous development even if agents crash or have to stop and start over with new conversations this      │
│   means all progress must be flagged in highly detailed and concise ways and agents must plan ahead to leave detailed next steps f or the next      │
│   agent or dev to pick up development testing and serverless deployment
